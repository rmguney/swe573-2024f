# Stufffinder (3F)

**Stufffinder** is a web application that allows users to search for and identify objects using data from Wikidata. It helps users discover information about unknown objects by querying by several attributes and feedback in form of comments by other users. The app uses Svelte for its frontend, Django as the backend framework, and PostgreSQL as the database. 

## Features

1. **User Input**: Users can open threads for objects by defining characteristics through Wikidata tags along with visual description and an image.
2. **SPARQL Queries**: App generates SPARQL queries to retrieve relevant objects from Wikidata.
3. **Thread Display**: Search results are displayed in these user created threads.
4. **Community Feedback**: Other users can comment in these threads, helping with the identification of the object.
